<!-- Human Tasks:
1. Verify PagerDuty integration is configured and on-call schedules are set up
2. Ensure Slack channels for incident communication are created
3. Validate access to Prometheus/Grafana dashboards for incident responders
4. Configure email distribution lists for incident notifications
5. Test incident response communication channels -->

# Mint Replica Lite Incident Response Procedures

<!-- Addresses requirement: Security Monitoring and Response (6.3.2) -->
## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive incident response procedures for the Mint Replica Lite system. It provides structured guidelines for identifying, classifying, and responding to various types of incidents to ensure minimal service disruption and maintain system security.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### SEV1 - Critical System-Wide Outage
- Complete system unavailability
- Data security breach
- Critical data loss or corruption
- Payment processing system failure
- Multi-region infrastructure failure

#### SEV2 - Major Functionality Impacted
- Single region availability issues
- Significant performance degradation
- Authentication system issues
- Financial data sync failures
- Critical feature unavailability

#### SEV3 - Minor Functionality Impacted
- Non-critical feature unavailability
- Minor performance issues
- Individual user account issues
- Non-critical data sync delays
- Isolated third-party integration failures

#### SEV4 - Minimal Impact
- Cosmetic issues
- Minor UI/UX problems
- Non-critical alerts
- Individual transaction sync delays
- Documentation issues

## Response Procedures

<!-- Addresses requirement: High Availability (2.5.4) -->
### Initial Response

1. Alert Verification
   - Monitor Prometheus alerts in Grafana dashboard
   - Verify alert authenticity and severity
   - Check related metrics and logs
   - Confirm impact scope

2. Impact Assessment
   - Determine affected services
   - Estimate user impact
   - Identify affected regions/components
   - Assess data integrity status

3. Team Mobilization
   - Notify incident commander
   - Engage required technical teams
   - Alert stakeholders based on severity
   - Establish communication channels

4. Communication Initiation
   - Create incident channel in Slack
   - Send initial notification to stakeholders
   - Update status page
   - Begin incident logging

```

### Investigation

<!-- Addresses requirement: Infrastructure Security (2.1) -->
1. Log Analysis
   - Review application logs
   - Check infrastructure logs
   - Analyze security logs
   - Examine audit trails

2. Metrics Review
   - Monitor system metrics in Grafana
   - Check resource utilization
   - Review performance metrics
   - Analyze error rates

3. Root Cause Analysis
   - Identify trigger events
   - Map failure cascade
   - Document timeline
   - Determine contributing factors

```

### Mitigation

1. Immediate Actions
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Enable fallback systems
   - Block security threats
   - Scale resources if needed

2. Service Restoration
   - Deploy fixes
   - Restore from backups if needed
   - Verify service health
   - Enable monitoring

3. Data Recovery
