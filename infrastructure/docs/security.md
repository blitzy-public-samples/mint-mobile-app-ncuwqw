## Overview

<!-- Addresses requirement: Infrastructure Security (2.4 Security Architecture) -->
The Mint Replica Lite system implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security architecture encompassing:
- Client-side security with platform-specific secure storage
- Transport layer security with TLS 1.3
- API security with OAuth 2.0 and JWT
- Data security with field-level encryption
- Infrastructure security with network policies and RBAC

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Implementation
<!-- Addresses requirement: Authentication and Authorization (6.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION) -->

#### Authentication Flow
1. Primary Authentication Methods:
   - Email/Password with strong password policies
   - Biometric authentication on mobile devices
   - OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication

2. Token Management:
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": {
       "type": "JWT",
       "expiry": "24 hours",
       "signing_algorithm": "RS256"
     },
     "refresh_token": {
       "type": "Opaque",
       "expiry": "30 days",
       "storage": "HttpOnly Cookie"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Session Security:
   - Server-side session validation
   - Redis-based session storage
   - Automatic session termination on security events

### Authorization Controls
<!-- Addresses requirement: Authentication and Authorization (6.1 AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION) -->

1. Role-Based Access Control:
